## Prerequisites:
1. Python
2. Matplotlib
3. openCV
4. pandas
5. sklearn
6. OS

## Procedure:

1. Install and run Libraries
2. Defining tumor class with 1 and non tumor with 0 also reshape all the images to an equal size
3. Split the dataset into training and testing dataset
4. Train the data using logistic regression and using SVM
5. Finally,testing for various training dataset
